# Simple Python Injector
 Simple Python Injector that I made using with the pymem library. (Also made it for contributing to my github page :wink: )

 The `pymem` library is used to automate the handling of the process name and ID. The `process_by_name()` method is used to get the process ID from the process name entered by the user. The `inject_dll()` method is then used to inject the DLL into the process.
